## 🧑‍💻 Behind The Code

### 🌈 Inspiration

go-shell was inspired by the desire to deeply understand how command-line shells work and to provide a tool that developers can use and extend. As Richard Feynman said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. This project embodies the philosophy that real understanding comes from building and creating.

### 💡 Challenges/Learnings

- **Challenges**: Ensuring compatibility with various external commands and handling different edge cases in command execution.
- **Learnings**: Deepened understanding of Go's `os/exec` package, process management
